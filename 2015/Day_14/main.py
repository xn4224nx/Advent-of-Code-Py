--- Day 14: Reindeer Olympics ---

This year is the Reindeer Olympics! Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must
rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of
his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.

Reindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not
moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.

PART 1: Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after
        exactly 2503 seconds, what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?
