--- Day 7: The Treachery of Whales ---

A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster
than you are. There's nowhere to run!

Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for
them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a
hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system
just beyond where they're aiming!

The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to
blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't
look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?

There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.

You quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle
input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make
all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little
fuel as possible.

Part 1:
    Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the
    least fuel possible. How much fuel must they spend to align to that
    position?
