--- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---

The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers 
which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the 
conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the power 
consumption.

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new 
binary numbers (called the gamma rate and the epsilon rate). The power 
consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most common bit in 
the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic report.

Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and
epsilon rate, then multiply them together. What is the power consumption of the 
submarine?
