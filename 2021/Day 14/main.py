--- Day 14: Extended Polymerization ---

The submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer
formula; specifically, it offers a polymer template and a list of pair insertion
rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result
after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.

The first line is the polymer template - this is the starting point of the
process. The following section defines the pair insertion rules.

Part 1:
    Apply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most
    and least common elements in the result. What do you get if you take the
    quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least
    common element?
