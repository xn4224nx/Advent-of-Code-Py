--- Day 13: Transparent Origami ---

The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. 0,0 represents the
top-left coordinate. The first value, x, increases to the right. The second
value, y, increases downward. So, the coordinate 3,0 is to the right of 0,0, and
the coordinate 0,7 is below 0,0.

Then, there is a list of fold instructions. Each instruction indicates a line on
the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper up (for horizontal y=...
lines) or left (for vertical x=... lines).

Part 1:
    How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction
    on your transparent paper?
