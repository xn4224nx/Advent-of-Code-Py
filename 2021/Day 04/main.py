--- Day 4: Giant Squid ---

The submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the
giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which
to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input).

The winning board is the first to get a row or column.

The score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum
of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then,
multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to
get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.

Part 1:
    To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will
    win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?
